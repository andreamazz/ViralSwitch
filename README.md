UISwitch subclass that 'infects' the parent view with the `onTintColor` when the switch is turned on. Inspired by [this Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/1749645-Contact-Sync) by [Ramotion](https://dribbble.com/teams/Ramotion).

#Installation
Using cocoapods:
`pod 'AMViralSwitch'`

#Usage
AMViralSwitch is a drop-in replacement of UISwitch. You just need to set the `onTintColor` property of the switch, and it will automatically _infect_ its superview with the selected color.

#Animate views
You can animate other views alongside the switch _infection_. Typically you'll want to change color to views or labels that are inside the same superview. You can animate CoreAnimation properties likes this: 
```objc
self.greenSwitch.animationElementsOn = @[
   @{ AMElementView: self.greenView.layer,
      AMElementKeyPath: @"backgroundColor", 
      AMElementFromValue: (id)[UIColor clearColor].CGColor,
      AMElementToValue: (id)[UIColor whiteColor].CGColor }
];
```

To animate the `textColor` of an `UILabel` the syntax is slightly different:
```objc
self.blueSwitch.animationElementsOn = @[
    @{ AMElementView: self.blueLabel,
       AMElementKeyPath: @"textColor",
       AMElementToValue: [UIColor whiteColor] }
];
```
Follow the same principle to animate the `tintColor` of your `UIButton`s:
```objc
self.blueSwitch.animationElementsOn = @[
    @{ AMElementView: self.infoButton,
       AMElementKeyPath: @"tintColor",
       AMElementToValue: [UIColor whiteColor] }
];
```
